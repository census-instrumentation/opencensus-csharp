## Notes on questionable decisions

1. Why `Span.Kind` has option to be `Unspecified`? Is it only needed for back
   compatibility or it is valid long term?
2. Span Kind detection logic and relation to `HasRemoteParent` flag. Should
   `HasRemoteParent` define span kind when `Span.Kind` was `Unspecified`?
   What if `HasRemoteParent` is `true` when `Span.Kind` is `Client`?
3. Should attribute `span.kind` be respected and has priority over `SpanKind`
   field?
4. When `Status` wasn't set - should it be treated as `OK` or `Unknown`?
5. ResultCode and ResponseCode calculation was implemented differently in
   Local Forwarder for Request and Dependency. Is there a reason for this?
6. Why use Canonical code, not the textual representation of it?
7. When http.url is bad formed â€“ should we store it in properties collection to
   preserve an original value?
8. I don't understand why this concatenation is required for identifiers like
   trace id an span id?
9. Should we recover url as https or http?
10. Will url or individual components win when looking at port, host, path? I
    think individual properties conflicting with url should win.
11. Why start and end time of span are not required fields?
12. Span
    [name](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-proto/blob/ba49f56771b83cff7bea7f34d1236fc139dbc471/src/opencensus/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L85-L86)
    is required. Does it mean that it's not empty?
13. LinkList should use `Attributes` class for consistency.
