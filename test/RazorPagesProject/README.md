# ASP.NET Core Integration Testing Sample

This sample illustrates integration testing of an [ASP.NET Core Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages) app. This sample demonstrates the features described in the [Integration tests in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests) topic.

If you aren't using an IDE with built-in testing features, execute the following command at a command prompt in the *tests/RazorPagesProject.Tests* folder:

```console
dotnet test
```
